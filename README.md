# Like Tamagotchi But Powered By Your Savings Account

Rough draft of a potential web app that helps users work towards savings goals with care of a Tamagotchi like creature. Users will eventually be able to customize and care for the character. For example, regular deposits keep the character healthy (feeding), and special points could be used to buy clothing items for the character. When the user reaches their savings goal, something fun could happen, like the character "graduating" and going out into the world, but other random events could be added in before this final goal as well.
